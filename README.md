#  Third-degree Interpolating Natural Spline Function (INSF3) creator.
#### Program draws INSF3 based on selected points on the coordinate axis.

It's implemented in **Python** with the use of **plotly.express** library, created as part of a competition in classes on **Numerical Analysis**.

For the moment it draws functions for input that is in the source code, but in the future I plan to add the ability to select points on the axis with GUI.
